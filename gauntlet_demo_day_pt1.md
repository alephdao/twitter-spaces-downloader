[0:00 - 0:04] (Music)
[0:04 - 0:14] (Silence)
[0:14] Speaker 1: You're good.
[0:14] Speaker 2: Awesome.
[0:14] Speaker 1: Uh welcome everybody to Gauntlet AI Demo Day.
[0:20] I know there's still a bunch of people, uh excuse me, still a bunch of people coming in, but uh we are so excited to have you all and those of you that are still joining.
[0:32] And those of you that are uh on the live stream.
[0:34] Hello to you too.
[0:36] Um, we are very, very, very excited to show you some of what we've got today.
[0:44] Um, for those of you that don't know what Gauntlet AI is, uh we're a 12 week program for engineers where essentially on the outside, what we do is take very smart people, um and week one, we shock the system by having them build apps, but not allowing them to write any code.
[1:11] So, our entire goal at Gauntlet AI is to get everybody on the cutting edge of AI, uh because that slope is pretty vertical.
[1:22] We think, uh and I'll I'll just say for for myself, when when we started Gauntlet AI on day one, I was pretty excited about the potential of what could happen if you have people building with AI, uh trying to adopt the newest models, the newest generative AI, everything as fast as you can, but I've been pretty blown away.
[1:55] And I think that what you will all see in a couple of different ways today is pretty wild as well.
[2:03] So, uh to give you an idea, nobody had ever heard of Gauntlet AI about four months ago.
[2:13] Every single student that you'll see today uh could have possibly heard about Gauntlet AI three weeks or three months and about two weeks ago.
[2:24] Um so pretty much everybody who is here saw that this was going to happen, dropped everything in their lives, jumped right on board, and two weeks later, they were enrolled and building and uh doing all of that as fast as they can.
[2:43] Um we're very selective.
[2:46] Uh we picked about two or 3% of the applicants.
[2:54] Um and then Gauntlet AI, the the name comes from our somewhat sink or swim environment.
[3:03] So every week there is a new challenge.
[3:06] If anybody doesn't make it acceptably through that week, um and I set those standards, uh then you don't move on to the next week.
[3:17] So the people that you see today, they made it all the way through the gauntlet and that's pretty exciting for us.
[3:26] Um but I want to zoom out just a little bit and talk about why any of this exists in the first place.
[3:35] Um there are a lot of different training programs out there.
[3:39] There's a lot of different ways that you can learn different things.
[3:44] Um but we have a couple singular focuses in mind, some of which are not obvious uh from the outside world.
[3:55] So the first is for me, transparently, uh I want to build a credential that is a stronger hiring signal than anything like a Stanford CS degree or an MIT CS degree.
[4:12] That's our that's my main overarching objective.
[4:19] Now, how do we get there?
[4:21] That's going to be a long journey.
[4:24] Um there's a lot that goes into it.
[4:26] Um but for these students, what you're going to see is that they can build things, that they can utilize the cutting edge techniques in AI.
[4:45] They all have very unique workflows.
[4:48] They all have, you know, they've been building uh a lot.
[4:54] You will see that they are very smart.
[4:57] Uh we select for that very intentionally and you'll see that they are very hardworking.
[5:07] Um the generally speaking, uh people show up in this office here at 8:00 a.m. uh 8:00 a.m. Central every day and they're here until midnight, 7 days a week the entire time.
[5:26] Uh Sunday starts a little bit later for church, but that's the only uh only exception that we've got.
[5:34] Um so people have been building 80, 100 plus hours a week and you know, people being really smart and working really hard, creates a little bit of magic.
[5:48] But I think perhaps the unspoken thing that all of the the gauntleters or the gauntlet students or the challengers or whatever everybody has decided to call them.
[6:02] Um, the unspoken part of that that I think is the most important is how quickly they learn.
[6:18] Everybody who is in Gauntlet AI is spending hours and hours each week learning about and keeping a record of the new things that they're encountering.
[6:35] They're figuring out how to jump into new spaces.
[6:40] Um they're building workflows for learning.
[6:47] They are uh rapidly acquiring expertise in whatever they're building.
[6:54] Um and they're staying on the cutting edge of AI.
[7:00] Our our thesis is that the the rate of change of AI is basically going vertical.
[7:12] Um we're not necessarily, you know, pioneering new methods of AI.
[7:18] We're not doing, you know, fundamental research.
[7:22] Our goal is just to get to the edge of what AI is capable of and ride that wave.
[7:30] Um we think doing that is possibly the biggest force multiplier in human history.
[7:39] And even versus what I expected, it's it is very, very, very powerful.
[7:51] Um I've been running schools, code schools for a very long time.
[7:58] Uh now what I what I see when I see a project, I have a, you know, kind of background mental process running of approximately how long I think it would take to to do any project, right?
[8:10] Devil's always in the details, but um there have been a number of companies that have come in and worked with us where their mental model says that something should take six months, maybe a year, and Gauntlet Challengers are knocking it out in literally 48 hours, 72 hours.
[8:34] And I know that seems crazy and people are going to keep calling me on it and I'm going to keep showing evidence of that.
[8:42] Um, but roughly, you know, now I have to tweak my thinking so that what I'm used to anticipating taking about a month, uh is somewhere between 24 and 48 hours and we see that regularly.
[9:00] Um, as one piece of evidence to that effect, um, we don't have enough room on this floor for all of the students to be here.
[9:09] Um so I posted a tweet or a post or a Z on X, um about half an hour ago and the students who are not up here presenting are downstairs on our other floor, and they're going to be building.
[9:28] Um, and they're going to be building whatever they find the most impressive from the replies to that tweet.
[9:39] So, from right now, they have about 5 hours to build whatever it is that you're requesting and they're going to come back in 5 hours and show us all what they've built.
[9:52] Um this is a demo day in a couple of different ways.
[9:56] Um, the other thing that they're going to do today and the bulk of where our time will be spent is walk us through the demos of what they've built.
[10:05] Now they've been at uh Gauntlet for about three months, a little less than three months.
[10:14] Um, the first month is online.
[10:17] The last couple months have been here in person in Austin.
[10:22] Um, but they started their projects that they're going to show to you about three weeks ago and most of them had two or three projects running simultaneously.
[10:36] So when you see something up here, adjust your mental model for that's taken them basically a couple of weeks to build.
[10:46] Um it's pretty, pretty wild.
[10:51] Um, so we're very excited to have you all here.
[10:54] Uh for those that are joining the stream, we're excited to uh have you all wherever you are virtually.
[11:02] Um, and I just want to say thank you to all of the the companies who have made this possible.
[11:15] Um, I mean millions and millions of dollars went into making this happen.
[11:20] Uh, the the the students pay nothing.
[11:27] Uh, the students were all flown here from all over the world.
[11:33] Uh they're put up in housing, they have offices.
[11:37] We have buses that run to and from the apartments, food, all sorts of events.
[11:43] Um that's only made possible by the hiring companies that hire these folks and fund this all.
[11:50] So thank you to the hiring companies.
[11:52] Thank you to the sponsoring companies.
[11:56] Um, and thank you to the the Challengers.
[12:02] Um, I think it's a little bit understated how crazy it is for some some people and especially, you know, nobody had heard of this program three weeks before it started.
[12:24] We hadn't announced it.
[12:26] It wasn't possible to have heard about it.
[12:31] Um, from when we announced it, there are a couple hundred people in those, you know, two or three weeks who dropped everything, decided to take a risk, uh decided that it was worth going a hundred hours a week after something, um at a pace that's mindboggling and sometimes unsustainable.
[13:01] Um, but that's that's not an easy thing to do.
[13:05] They put a lot of uh hope and a lot of trust in me, um in the companies that are hiring and uh they they took a big risk and worked extremely hard.
[13:20] So, um I want to say thank you to all those of you who who did that and who did this crazy thing.
[13:27] And I think all of us to a person are very, very pleased with what the results have been.
[13:35] Um, so with that, I am going to uh a couple items of business.
[13:42] First is uh you can find my tweet.
[13:45] I've pinned it.
[13:47] Um, I'm Austin on X, uh a n is my username.
[13:56] Um so please reply to that with recommendations or suggestions or requests for what the Challengers downstairs are going to build and they're going to show you what they can build in five hours.
[14:09] Um, and now I'm really, really excited to get to the demos.
[14:14] Uh so I'm going to have Ash who's one of our program managers here and's been working with the the Challengers day in and day out.
[14:22] Uh he's going to go over some logistics and introduce you to some stuff that in very Gauntlet nature, uh was built in the last 24 hours or so, um to to make it a little bit easier to follow along.
[14:40] So, uh Ash.
[14:45] All right.
[14:49] Hey guys, and welcome again to the 1,000 people watching us on X right now.
[14:57] So, I just want to go through some of the logistical details and some of the things that we have available to you to sort of meet our graduates and understand what they've created.
[15:10] So, at demoday.ccoai.com, you'll be able to create an account and you'll be able to see each of the graduates and all the projects that they have.
[15:22] At the same time, as the graduates get up here, you'll be able to see who's presenting.
[15:29] Each of the graduates are going to be presenting for three to four minutes.
[15:34] They'll be going through their applications and then walking through a little bit of their AI first coding framework.
[15:42] They've been preparing for this for about two to three days now, and the goal of these presentations is to make sure that they can showcase what they can build in just a few weeks, but at the same time, how quickly they can build with AI and build a viable product that they can launch.
[16:03] So you'll see some people trying to uh launch a product and get users.
[16:09] You'll see some people showcasing a product that they've built super quickly and uh how quickly they're able to build with AI and add to the sort of ecosystem and domain.
[16:22] So, without further ado, we're going to get started with our first Gauntlet Challenger and we'll be going one by one throughout the entire day and as we go through these different presentations, if you want to rate the presentation, you can do so on the website, and if you have any comments or suggestions or feedback for the presenter, you can leave them there as well.
[16:52] So, I want to welcome our first challenger, Benjamin Vizzi.
[17:19] All right.
[17:23] Good morning everybody.
[17:27] Just make sure we're getting hooked up to the monitor here.
[17:32] All right, we're good to go.
[17:36] All right, good morning everybody.
[17:39] Uh this is a special day.
[17:43] You're going to see a lot of cool presentations, you'll meet a lot of great people, and you'll probably forget most of it.
[17:55] And I would argue that most days something special happens, something you want to remember and these days are even more difficult to remember.
[18:09] We have some solutions for this.
[18:12] Maybe people write things down in a notebook, which is very difficult to query.
[18:19] Maybe you use Apple Notes or voice memos which all have their own drawbacks.
[18:28] They're built for a lot of things, but not one specific thing.
[18:34] So my name is Benji and today I'll be presenting Momo where we reimagine voice memos from the ground up with AI.
[18:47] I've got my app set to the action button, so you can open it any time.
[18:53] And with one tap, you can start recording.
[18:59] We have some tags up here.
[19:03] In your settings, you can decide which tags show up on the home screen from somebody you met, a great idea you had, whether it happened now or maybe a dream that you just woke up from.
[19:19] And of course, our app is localized in Japanese.
[19:24] But we'll keep it in English for this audience.
[19:28] And uh let's record something.
[19:33] Presenting right now in front of a beautiful group of people.
[19:40] One thing about voice memos is Apple's audio transcription is not so great.
[19:48] So we use Whisper AI, Whisper API, which allows you to transcribe in any language and using AI, it's way more effective.
[20:01] And so let's check it out.
[20:03] We'll make this a little bigger and as you can see, I've already been recording what I've been doing all day, tagging it and if I want to go to the filter, we can see who I met.
[20:21] Awesome.
[20:23] I realized Nathan was from Tampa where I used to live and I can't remember where I was talking to Nathan.
[20:34] Perfect.
[20:36] We can see it was right here in the office, of course.
[20:42] So, some of us will have a lot of our moments in the same place.
[20:49] We go to the office every day or we're at home.
[20:53] But imagine you're traveling.
[20:56] Imagine you're on a business trip.
[21:00] You want to remember where you were at and when you were at.
[21:06] The beauty of Momo is that it takes where you were and when you were, so you can always remember everything about that moment.
[21:18] And the best part is it's all done in iCloud, which means I can't see your data.
[21:24] Uh if you believe Apple, they can't see your data.
[21:29] So it's completely private and with one tap, you can remember everything you've been doing all day as soon as you want to.
[21:42] So, thank you.
[21:43] I'm Benji.
[21:44] This was Momo and uh thanks for coming today.
[21:58] All right.
[22:01] Next up, we have the team Tinyvec.
[22:04] We have Tyler, Matt and Spencer.
[22:08] Now Tinyvec has become a popular library across the entire cohort to power local vector databases and rag based solutions.
[22:19] Let's welcome team Tinyvec.
[23:18] Hi, my name is Tyler.
[23:21] This is Matt and this is Spencer.
[23:25] I set out to create Tinyvec, an open source vector database that doesn't suck.
[23:36] Vector databases power the core of almost every single AI application you see out there today to provide relevant context to bridge the gap of LLMs and their training data sets.
[23:55] Tinyvec is unique in the fact that it does not require an internet connection or large server setup to run.
[24:05] It's loved by developers especially here at Gauntlet.
[24:10] It's extremely fast and simple to use.
[24:17] So, why should you use Tinyvec?
[24:21] As you can see from this bar graph, it's up to five times faster than other vector databases available today.
[24:34] We think that any serious AI application is going to be required to use Tinyvec.
[24:42] It offers the fastest search time, the lowest latency.
[24:49] Therefore, your customers are going to have the best end user experience possible.
[24:59] Tinyvec runs on any device, no matter how constrained the resources are.
[25:06] It can run on iPhones, tablets, desktop computers.
[25:12] Anything that can use a file, Tinyvec can run.
[25:21] While Tinyvec has only been out for a couple of weeks now, we've already seen some great market adoption with about 3,000 downloads in the nodejs and Python ecosystem.
[25:37] This tells us that developers and AI application owners love incorporating Tinyvec into their AI applications.
[25:47] In fact, here at Gauntlet Demo Day, you're going to be seeing a handful of applications that are using Tinyvec to supercharge their AI applications.
[26:00] Now, I want to pass it to Matt who's going to talk about some of the awesome innovations we've been able to see for mobile applications.
[26:10] Open source models are increasingly competitive with closed source ones.
[26:15] There is no mo.
[26:17] The key were we use our experience and personalization and an important part of that is privacy.
[26:27] Especially given recent regulations that restrict the movement of user data across borders.
[26:33] Tinyvac solves these problems.
[26:36] It runs anywhere, it's so fast, the resource requirements are tiny and the user's data never needs to leave their device.
[26:47] Existing local vector databases are slow, complicated to use and resource intensive.
[26:55] Tinyvec on iPhone is 20 times faster than the leading alternatives.
[27:09] Tinyvec runs anywhere.
[27:16] But sometimes, Tinyvec is the leading option for applications that want to use AI on device, but sometimes you need to expand beyond the user's device, which is why today we're excited to announce that Tinyvec is expanding to the cloud.
[27:35] Tinyvec Cloud is the Versal for AI deployment for the next million vibe coders.
[27:43] Uh it's production scale with zero hassle, very simple pricing.
[27:50] And essentially we want to take your and development environment and very quickly make it available on the cloud.
[27:58] With a single line of code change, following the same Tinyvec API, we want to keep things as easy as possible.
[28:07] You set your public URI, bada bing bada boom, you have your vector search working for you.
[28:14] To move from Tinyvec, we've been look developing locally, it's as easy as drag and dropping a couple files.
[28:21] This means you have production vector search in a matter of seconds.
[28:30] This completely wipes out a lot of the competitors in the space and with a full platform like this, we're able to do some really neat things.
[28:39] For both technical and non-technical people, we have this clustering and and visualization, so you can see what embeddings are closer to each other, where your documents lie on the grand scheme of the black box that is um AI.
[28:59] And so this pricing advantage is absolutely insane.
[29:03] A lot of these vector databases will charge you for nickel and dime you left, right and center.
[29:09] Tinyvec, uh-uh.
[29:11] It's very lean under the hood, so the pricing is very lean on top of it.
[29:17] So, up to 10 times cheaper and this is where Tinyvec can go.
[29:23] I mean there's millions of ideas where to take an incredible idea and scale it even further.
[29:30] Um, over time the goal is to become a cornerstone in AI development, especially for this new age of how quickly we need to continue to build things with how great of an API Tinyvec really is.
[29:44] So that's Tinyvec.
[29:46] I uh appreciate you all coming out.
[29:50] Uh this is Tyler, Matt and I'm Spencer.
[30:14] All right.
[30:17] Next up, we have a challenger who has used an AI assistant to see if we can change radio signals coming across from different stations across Austin.
[30:28] We have Stephen Newman and Gig Velum.
[31:31] Okay, we're ready to go.
[31:33] So, I'm actually working on uh a gifted and talented education platform that does incorporate software to find radio as one of its modules.
[31:48] Gifted and talented education is probably one of the most important parts of our society, but it often gets overlooked.
[31:59] Countries like China, Singapore, and Finland, they don't overlook it.
[32:05] They're pouring a lot of funding into these programs and we should probably follow suit if we don't want to get left behind.
[32:16] So these kids are capable of learning new technologies, not just uh a curriculum that's advanced, but exposing them to advanced technology as well.
[32:34] So, what I've done here is made available some modules, learning modules in radio technology, quantum computing, material science, computer security, robotics, sensors and circuits.
[32:54] And these are available for rental for individual students or entire classrooms.
[33:02] And the cool thing about them is that they don't require an instructor.
[33:07] They're all AI guided, first principles learning from the very ground up.
[33:17] And here's uh an example of the first module here, which is the software defined radio module.
[33:25] And you'll see we've got our signals here on the left and on the right uh is integrated uh an AI tutor that will walk the students through everything from learning what uh a wave is, what a radio wave is, and building all the way up to intercepting satellite signals, doing general signals analysis, and even launching their own radio station, choosing their own programming and music.
[33:57] So not only is it very educational, but that's a lot of fun.
[34:02] This is the kind of thing kids are going to want to participate in.
[34:07] It'll be available for middle school students, high school students, and the AI tutor automatically works with whatever level they're already at.
[34:20] So doesn't doesn't get boring, they jump right in and I've got a QR code right here.
[34:30] So if anyone knows any students who want to launch their own radio station, then go ahead and uh we'll put them on the list and have a great time.
[34:44] Okay, thank you.
[35:04] All right.
[35:06] Next up, we have AI powered video generation with Sfy.me, Scott, Chris, and Kevin.
[35:43] All right, how's everyone doing?
[35:49] Perfect.
[35:51] All right, I'll start while there's getting set up.
[35:54] Hi everyone, my name is Scott Gba.
[35:57] I'm here with Chris Vich and Kevin Ma. We are focusing on short form video content.
[36:06] So short form video content is a $100 billion dollar industry and as this industry has grown, several companies have made video editors specialized for short form content creators.
[36:21] Uh but these editors are often difficult to learn, expensive and quite frankly, boring to use.
[36:29] Um the truth is most short form video content creators aren't trying to make, you know, the super high polished content.
[36:37] They're trying to make funny, ridiculous, viral memes to share with their friends.
[36:44] So that's why we created, hopefully they'll get this plugged in in a second so we can do the big reveal.
[36:59] All right, well that's why we created Sfy.me. A fun, ridiculous and ridiculously fun and ridiculously easy to use viral content generator.
[37:18] So we're going to do a live demo today.
[37:21] So this is the current uh landing screen.
[37:26] And when you the user logs in, they're taken to a dashboard where they can navigate to the different features of the website.
[37:34] Now, uh the main feature is the video maker which Chris will walk through in a second, but they can also access their projects, the media library which contains a library of commonly used memes that anyone can access and like quickly load into their videos as well as they can upload their own media.
[37:52] So now Chris is going to do a walk through of the video maker.
[37:57] Awesome.
[37:58] Thanks Scott.
[37:59] I'll walk through uh some of the video maker capabilities.
[38:03] We try to emphasize simplicity over complexity uh for this for this uh feature right here.
[38:10] So I can actually put in an existing uh media resource.
[38:14] We'll have this video uh explaining mitochondria.
[38:20] Uh we have a few different options.
[38:23] We can use modify the video format as well as a split screen uh that's sort of common in a lot of meme formats you might see uh nowadays.
[38:32] So we'll actually try that.
[38:34] We'll put in a popular uh Subway Surfers uh clip.
[38:39] We have the ability to control the simultaneous audio.
[38:44] Uh there's YouTube to MP3 transcript.
[38:47] Uh but we'll actually do our own text to speech transcript using some of the compelling voices that we have actually available on the application.
[38:56] So, we'll try Donald Trump uh just to try to create a compelling video.
[39:03] This is a pretty quick process.
[39:06] We're using Speechify to create the MP3 file and then opening AI whisper to transcribe the VTT.
[39:15] So we'll get the audio clip.
[39:18] Uh we'll add that to the video and then we'll add some subtitles as well.
[39:23] So, we'll try the full uh feature right here.
[39:36] So you can hear the simultaneous audio as well as the newly generated text to speech.
[39:41] We have a large number of other features that we want to implement or we couldn't present uh today including AI clipping um and some other image overlays and dynamic AI image overlays as well.
[39:55] Uh but I'll uh leave this off to Kevin who will explain our marketing strategy and approach.
[40:01] Thanks Chris.
[40:02] So we have a weight list live at Sfy.me on the internet and we're planning on launching within the next few weeks.
[40:09] So during those next few weeks, we're going to be using our platform as our only uh marketing tool.
[40:15] So we're going to be generating all our own our advertisement using our tool and then uh posting it to the internet and then we'll be launching soon.
[40:24] And then we're going to be launching with two tiers, uh one core plan with the uh core functionality that you've seen here today.
[40:33] Uh it's going to be $9.99 the month and we're also going to have an additional premium tier with access to video generation models, um an iOS app, uh automatic script writing and a lot of other features.
[40:50] So, uh sign up with the weight list now at Sfy.me and get slopping.
[41:25] All right.
[41:27] Next up, we have CCO Vibe with Roger, Pat Roger, Pat, Adam and Ross.
[42:28] Okay, we are CCO Vibe.
[42:34] Um our website is CCOvibe.com and you can see our presentation by clicking right here.
[42:43] Um we are a platform to uh train and uh validate CCO Vibers because the future of coding and development is going to be with Vibers.
[43:01] Vibers.
[43:03] Vibers, Vibers.
[43:06] Roger, relax, relax, relax.
[43:08] Relax, I'll take over from here.
[43:13] Only this past Monday, we were on a call with a potential client.
[43:19] For us, selling software is second nature.
[43:24] We've done it for years.
[43:28] Confidently, we told him, look, what used to take us three months, we can now achieve as AI engineers in just one week.
[43:41] Initially, it seemed like he believed in us, but soon we sensed hesitation and skepticism.
[43:53] The problem was clear.
[43:56] He didn't trust that high quality, production grade software could really be delivered in just one week.
[44:06] And honestly, we get it.
[44:10] From the outside, this speed sounds almost unbelievable.
[44:18] While it's clear to us inside our bubble, the wider world remains skeptical.
[44:26] This is our big challenge, selling AI first engineering to a market accustomed to traditional timelines.
[44:36] How do we bridge that gap?
[44:38] That's exactly why we built CCO Vibe.
[44:43] Um, users can come to our platform and they go through a series of learning paths which are then reviewed by uh their peers, so that they can then go to folks out in the world who don't necessarily trust vibe coders and say, look, I've built all these things and we're validated by my local peers.
[45:12] Um, they can also make pull requests to the platform because it's open source.
[45:18] So with that package, they can then go on and say to people like, look, I've built all this stuff, you
