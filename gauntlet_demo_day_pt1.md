[0:00 - 0:45] (Silence)

[0:45 - 11:22]
A lot of us are always on I have one little stage Maybe a little bit Yeah, as much as I can All right.

Cool. Cool.

Cool. All right.

You wanna I
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

You're good? Awesome.

Excuse me.

Uh, we are so excited to have you all and those of you that are still joining and those of you that are, uh, on the livestream. Hello to you too.

We are very, very, very excited to show you some of what we've got today.

for those of you that don't know what Gullet AI is, uh, we're a 12 week program for engineers where essentially on the outside what we do is take very smart people, um, and week one we shock the system by having them build apps but not allowing them to write any code.

So our entire goal at Gullet AI is to get everybody on the cutting edge of AI, uh, because that slope is pretty vertical.

and all just say for, for myself, when, when we started Gullet AI, on day one, I was pretty excited about the potential of what could happen if you have people building with AI, uh, trying to adopt the newest models, the newest generative AI, everything as fast as you can.

But I've been pretty blown away, and I think that what you will all see in a couple of different ways today is pretty wild as well.

To give you an idea, nobody had ever heard of Gullet AI about four months ago.

Every single student that you'll see today, uh, could have possibly heard about Gullet AI three weeks or three months and about two weeks ago.

Saw that this was going to happen, dropped everything in their lives, jumped right on board, and two weeks later they were enrolled and building and, uh, doing all of that as fast as they can.

we picked about two or three percent of the applicants.

the name comes from our somewhat sinker swim environment.

So every week there is a new challenge.

Um and I set those standards.

The people that you see today, they made it all the way through the Gullet and that's pretty exciting for us.

There are a lot of different training programs out there.

But we had a couple singular focuses in mind, some of which are not obvious, uh, from the outside world.

I want to build a credential that is a stronger hiring signal than anything like a Stanford CS degree or an MIT CS degree.

That's that's my main overarching objective.

how do we get there? that's going to be a long journey.

What you're going to see is that they can build things really that they can utilize the cutting edge techniques in AI.

We select for that very intentionally.

The generally speaking, people show up in this office here at eight AM, uh, eight AM central every day, and they're here until midnight.

Sunday starts a little bit later for church, but that's the only, uh, only exception that we've got.

people being really smart and working really hard, creates a little bit of magic.

that all of the, or the challenge Whatever everybody has decided to call them, the unspoken part of that that I think is the most important is how quickly they learn.

Everybody who is in Gullet AI is spending hours and hours each week learning about and keeping a record of the new things that they're encountering, they're figuring out how to jump into new spaces.

building workflows for learning, they are, uh, rapidly acquiring expertise in whatever they're building, and they're staying on the cutting edge of AI.

Our thesis is that the rate of change of AI is basically going vertical.

We're not necessarily pioneering new methods of AI.

Our goal is just to get to the edge of what AI is capable of and ride that wave.

We think doing that is possibly the biggest force multiplier in human history, and even versus what I expected, it's it is very, very, very powerful.

code schools for a very long time.

Now what I see when I see a project, I have a, you know, kind of background mental process running of approximately how long I think it would take to, to do any project, right?

But there have been a number of companies that have come in and worked with us where their mental model says that something should take six months, maybe a year, and Gullet challengers are knocking it out in literally 48 hours, 72 hours.

People are going to keep calling me on it, and I'm going to keep showing evidence of that.

Now I have to tweak my thinking so that what I'm used to anticipating taking about a month, uh, is somewhere between 24 and 48 hours.

As one piece of evidence to that effect, um, we don't have enough room on this floor for all of the students to be here.

tweet, or a post, or a Z on X, um, about half an hour ago.

They're going to be building.

They're going to be building whatever they find the most impressive from the replies to that tweet.

From right now, they have about five hours to build whatever it is that you're requesting and they're going to come back in five hours and show us all what they've built.

The other thing that they're going to do today, and the bulk of where our time will be spent, is walk us through the demos of what they've built.

Gullet for about three months.

Started their projects that they're going to show to you about three weeks ago, and most of them had two or three projects running simultaneously.

Adjust your mental model for that's taken them basically a couple of weeks to build.

So we're very excited to have you all here, for those that are joining the stream.

Thank you to all of the the companies who have made this possible.

The students pay nothing.

Thank you to the hiring companies.

I think it's a little bit understated how crazy it is for some, some people and especially, you know, nobody had heard of this program three weeks before it started.

We had announced it.

There are a couple hundred people in those, you know, two or three weeks, who dropped everything, decided to take a risk, uh, decided that it was worth going a hundred hours a week after something, um, at a pace that's mind boggling and sometimes unsustainable.

That's not an easy thing to do.

Thank you to all those of you who did that and who did this crazy thing.

All of us to a person are very, very pleased with what the results have been.

I'm going to a couple items of business.

Find my tweet, I've pinned it.

So please reply to that with recommendations or suggestions or requests for what the challenge downstairs are going to build.

Uh, so I'm going to have Ash, who's one of our program managers here and's been working with the challengers day in and day out.

Nature, uh, was built in the last 24 hours or so, um, to, to make it a little bit easier to follow along.

All right.

All right.

Hey guys, and welcome again to the 1000 people watching us on X right now.

So, I just want to go through some of the logistical details and some of the things that we have available to you to sort of meet our graduates and understand what they've created.

You'll be able to create an account and you'll be able to see each of the graduates and all the projects that they have.

Each of the graduates are going to be presenting for 3 to 4 minutes.

They've been preparing for this for about two to three days now, and the goal of these presentations is to make sure that they can showcase what they can build in just a few weeks, but at the same time, how quickly they can build with AI and build a viable product that they can launch.

launch product users showing the product how quickly able domain So without further ado, we're going to get started with our first champion go throughout the day different presentations the website feedback the presenter.

So I want to welcome our first challenger, Benjamin.

[11:22 - 13:24]
All right, good morning everybody.

Just make sure we're getting hooked up to the monitor here.

All right, we're good to go.

Hi, this is a special day.

You're gonna see a lot of cool presentations, you'll meet a lot of great people.

And you'll probably forget most of it.

Most days something special happens.

We have some solutions for this.

Apple I I just to give an idea was from
It's all in means data apple can't see tap.

So thank you This was thanks for coming today.
[13:24 - 13:54]
Next up, we have the team Tinyvec.

Now Tinyvec has become a popular library across the entire cohort to power local vector databases and rag based solutions.

[13:54 - 16:59]
Hi, my name is Tyler.

I set out to create Tinyvec, an open source vector database that doesn't suck.

Tinyvec is unique in the fact that it does not require an internet connection or large server setup to run.

So, why should you use Tinyvec?

As you can see, from this bar graph, it's up to five times faster than other vector databases available today.

It offers the fastest search time, the lowest latency.

Tinyvec runs on any device, no matter how constrained the resources are.

It can run on iPhones, tablets, desktop computers.

While Tinyvec has only been out for a couple of weeks now, we've already seen some great market adoption with about 3,000 downloads in the Nojs and Python ecosystem.

In fact, here at you're going to be seeing a handful of applications that are using Tinyvec to supercharge their AI applications.

And I just to about some.

Open source are and data tiny resource iPhone times alternatives.

But the applications but Cloud is a for the can make the public you search.

vector search in a matter of.

We have
