[00:01:22] Speaker 1: I mean I'll I'll move out to the center, but I'll be I'll be kind of glued here.
[00:01:27] Speaker 1: Let's see.
[00:01:27] Speaker 1: This I don't think tested it with a phone, okay?
[00:01:31] Speaker 1: Usbc?
[00:01:32] Speaker 1: Yep.
[00:01:36] Speaker 1: Okay, it'll show up there once it connects, if it connects.
[00:01:42] Speaker 1: I can run down and get another dongle.
[00:01:44] Speaker 1: Okay.
[00:01:44] Speaker 1: Oh, I saw it.
[00:01:45] Speaker 1: Oh, you saw it?
[00:01:50] Speaker 1: Do you have to configure it somewhere in here?
[00:01:55] Speaker 1: Is it showing up?
[00:01:56] Speaker 1: Says dog connector. connector.
[00:01:59] Speaker 1: So maybe let's try to mirror.
[00:02:01] Speaker 1: Oh, there it is.
[00:02:02] Speaker 1: Okay, that's sweet.
[00:02:05] Speaker 1: Cool.
[00:02:05] Speaker 1: No audio, right?
[00:02:07] Speaker 1: No audio.
[00:02:07] Speaker 1: Okay.
[00:02:07] Speaker 1: You're going to be glued your stuff to the phone, right?
[00:02:10] Speaker 1: So you're going uh can I use this?
[00:02:14] Speaker 1: Cool.
[00:02:15] Speaker 1: So for one or the other.
[00:02:18] Speaker 1: I'll use this one.
[00:02:19] Speaker 1: So you're going to use this but then roam the stage.
[00:02:24] Speaker 1: Maybe a little bit, yeah, as much as I can.
[00:02:26] Speaker 1: You can move the.
[00:02:27] Speaker 1: I don't want this to get disconnected.
[00:02:29] Speaker 1: Right.
[00:02:30] Speaker 1: Yeah.
[00:02:30] Speaker 1: I'll be careful.
[00:02:34] Speaker 1: Just straight on the yeah.
[00:02:39] Speaker 1: Okay.
[00:02:40] Speaker 1: Cool.
[00:02:41] Speaker 1: Yeah, if you want to use this one, just grab it and you'll be right.
[00:02:44] Speaker 1: Okay.
[00:02:45] Speaker 1: Okay, thanks.
[00:02:45] Speaker 1: Right now?
[00:02:48] Speaker 1: Just take the stage.
[00:02:49] Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:06] Speaker 1: All right.
[00:07:06] Speaker 1: Uh can you hear me?
[00:07:09] Speaker 2: You're good.
[00:07:10] Speaker 1: Awesome.
[00:07:11] Speaker 1: Uh welcome everybody to Gauntlet AI Demo Day.
[00:07:15] Speaker 1: I know there's still a bunch of people, uh excuse me, still a bunch of people coming in.
[00:07:20] Speaker 1: But, uh we are so excited to have you all and those of you that are still joining.
[00:07:25] Speaker 1: And those of you that are, uh, on the live stream, hello to you too.
[00:07:30] Speaker 1: Um, we are very, very, very excited to show you some of what we've got today.
[00:07:36] Speaker 1: Um, for those of you that don't know what Gauntlet AI is, uh, we're a 12-week program for engineers, where essentially on the outside, what we do is take very smart people, um, and week one, we shock the system by having them build apps, but not allowing them to write any code.
[00:08:05] Speaker 1: So our entire goal at Gauntlet AI is to get everybody on the cutting edge of AI, uh, because that slope is pretty vertical.
[00:08:15] Speaker 1: We think, uh, and I'll I'll just say for for myself, when when we started Gauntlet AI, on day one, I was pretty excited about the potential of what could happen if you have people building with AI, uh, trying to adopt the newest models, the newest generative AI, everything as fast as you can.
[00:08:43] Speaker 1: But I've been pretty blown away.
[00:08:46] Speaker 1: And I think that what you will all see in a couple of different ways today is pretty wild as well.
[00:08:53] Speaker 1: So, uh, to give you an idea, nobody had ever heard of Gauntlet AI about four months ago.
[00:09:00] Speaker 1: Every single student that you'll see today, uh, could have possibly heard about Gauntlet AI three weeks or three months and about two weeks ago.
[00:09:09] Speaker 1: Um, so pretty much everybody who is here saw that this was going to happen, dropped everything in their lives, jumped right on board, and two weeks later, they were enrolled and building and, uh, doing all of that as fast as they can.
[00:09:25] Speaker 1: Um, we're very selective.
[00:09:27] Speaker 1: Uh, we picked about two or three percent of the applicants.
[00:09:33] Speaker 1: Um, and then Gauntlet AI, the name comes from our somewhat sink or swim environment.
[00:09:40] Speaker 1: So every week there is a new challenge.
[00:09:43] Speaker 1: If anybody doesn't make it acceptably through that week, um, and I set those standards, uh, then you don't move on to the next week.
[00:09:52] Speaker 1: So the people that you see today, they made it all the way through the gauntlet, and that's pretty exciting for us.
[00:10:00] Speaker 1: Um, but I want to zoom out just a little bit and talk about why any of this exists in the first place.
[00:10:07] Speaker 1: Um, there are a lot of different training programs out there.
[00:10:11] Speaker 1: There's a lot of different ways that you can learn different things.
[00:10:14] Speaker 1: Um, but we had a couple singular focuses in mind, some of which are not obvious, uh, from the outside world.
[00:10:24] Speaker 1: So the first is, for me, transparently, uh, I want to build a credential that is a stronger hiring signal than anything like a Stanford CS degree or an MIT CS degree.
[00:10:40] Speaker 1: That's our that's my main overarching objective.
[00:10:44] Speaker 1: Now, how do we get there?
[00:10:46] Speaker 1: That's going to be a long journey.
[00:10:48] Speaker 1: Um, there's a lot that goes into it.
[00:10:50] Speaker 1: Um, but for these students, what you're going to see is that they can build things really, that they can utilize the cutting edge techniques in AI.
[00:11:04] Speaker 1: They all have very unique workflows.
[00:11:07] Speaker 1: They all have, you know, they've been building, uh, a lot.
[00:11:11] Speaker 1: You will see that they are very smart.
[00:11:14] Speaker 1: Uh, we select for that very intentionally.
[00:11:18] Speaker 1: And you'll see that they are very hardworking.
[00:11:21] Speaker 1: Um, the generally speaking, uh, people show up in this office here at 8:00 a.m., uh, 8:00 a.m.
[00:11:31] Speaker 1: Central every day, and they're here until midnight, seven days a week, the entire time.
[00:11:39] Speaker 1: Uh, Sunday starts a little bit later for church, but that's the only, uh, only exception that we've got.
[00:11:46] Speaker 1: Um, so people have been building 80, 100 plus hours a week and, you know, people being really smart and working really hard creates a little bit of magic.
[00:11:59] Speaker 1: But I think perhaps the unspoken thing that all of the the Gauntleters or the Gauntlet students or the challengers or whatever everybody has decided to call them.
[00:12:08] Speaker 1: Um, the unspoken part of that that I think is the most important is how quickly they learn.
[00:12:21] Speaker 1: Everybody who is in Gauntlet AI is spending hours and hours each week learning about and keeping a record of the new things that they're encountering.
[00:12:34] Speaker 1: They're figuring out how to jump into new spaces.
[00:12:38] Speaker 1: Um, they're building workflows for learning.
[00:12:43] Speaker 1: They are, uh, rapidly acquiring expertise in whatever they're building, um, and they're staying on the cutting edge of AI.
[00:12:54] Speaker 1: Our our thesis is that the the rate of change of AI is basically going vertical.
